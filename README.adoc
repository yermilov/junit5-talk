Home for JUG UA talk link:http://jug.ua/2017/04/junit-5-project-reactor/[JUnit 5: The Rise of Jupiter, window="_blank"].

The planet Jupiter (5th! in the Solar System) needs 11 years to make one complete orbit around the Sun. So do JUnit needs 11 years to get a new major release, which means it’s going to be really huge.

Milestone 3 is already available and GA is scheduled on Q3 2017, so now it’s the best time learn and discuss how automating testing is going to look like very soon.

In this talk we will go through JUnit 5 changes and see how they will influence test code we write. Also we will discuss JUnit 5 architectural approach, how it can be extended and how it turns JUnit from test framework into test platform.
